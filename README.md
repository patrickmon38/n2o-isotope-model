# n2o-isotope-model
Time-Dependent Model of N2O Cycling: tracks d15N2O-alpha, d15N2O-beta, and d18O-N2O from different substrates and includes a cost function to be optimized to solve for different cycling processes.

n2o_clustering_for_new is also included as an example file that is compatible with the Rcode

The code is formatted as an R-Markdown file and knit HTML. The function has three main parts: Model Setup, Model, and MSE Calculation for Optimization. When running the model for figures and to investigate output, it is run without the MSE calculation and optimization. That is, just the model setup and model portions are used.
